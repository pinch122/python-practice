-- DQL
-- DQL is a subset of SQL used for querying and retrieving data from a database. 
-- Advanced DQL commands such as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and HAVING.

-- 1. GROUP BY: Used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
-- 2. ORDER BY: Used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns.
-- 3. HAVING: Used to filter groups based on a condition, often used with GROUP BY.

CREATE DATABASE School;

USE School;

CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10)
);


INSERT INTO students (name, age, gender) VALUES
('pinchu', 18, 'Female'),
('puneet', 22, 'Female'),
('Shiv', 20, 'Male');



--  GROUP BY
-- Find the number of students of each gender.
SELECT gender, COUNT(*)
FROM students
GROUP BY gender;

-- ORDER BY
-- Fetch all student names and ages, ordered by age in descending order.
SELECT name, age
FROM students
ORDER BY age DESC;

-- HAVING with GROUP BY
-- Find the number of students of each gender where the count of students is greater than 1.
SELECT gender, COUNT(*)
FROM students
GROUP BY gender
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

--  GROUP BY and ORDER BY
-- Find the average age of students for each gender and order the result by average age.
SELECT gender, AVG(age) 
FROM students
GROUP BY gender
ORDER BY average_age;

--  Using WHERE with GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) 
FROM students
WHERE name IN ('pinchu', 'puneet')
GROUP BY gender
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY student_count DESC;
