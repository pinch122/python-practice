what is panda?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

Why Use Pandas?

Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.

What Can Pandas Do?
Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
What is average value?
Max value?
Min value?









# importing data 
import pandas as pd

mydataset = {
  'cars': ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
  'passings': [3, 7, 2]
}

myvar = pd.DataFrame(mydataset)

print(myvar)





#creating a simple panda from a list 
import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a)

print(myvar)






# Create your own labels:

import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a, index = ["x", "y", "z"])

print(myvar)




# creating simple panda from dictionary 

import pandas as pd

calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}

myvar = pd.Series(calories)

print(myvar)




# creating series when something is specified

import pandas as pd

calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}

myvar = pd.Series(calories, index = ["day1", "day2"])

print(myvar)

#output

day1    420
day2    380
dtype: int64


DataFrames:
Data sets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames.

import pandas as pd

data = {
  "calories": [420, 380, 390],
  "duration": [50, 40, 45]
}

myvar = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(myvar)

#output
   calories  duration
0       420        50
1       380        40
2       390        45

# if you want to locate a row you can use 
print(df.loc[0])

#multiple rows then 

print(df.loc[[0, 1]])









example

import pandas as pd

data = {
  "calories": [420, 380, 390],
  "duration": [50, 40, 45]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data, index = ["day1", "day2", "day3"])

print(df) 

#cN USE NAME TO LOCATE AS WELL
print(df.loc["day2"])
