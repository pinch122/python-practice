#NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

#NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

#The array object in NumPy is called ndarray

#NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.



#using tuple to create num py array

import numpy as np

arr = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

print(arr)

#0-D Arrays

import numpy as np

arr = np.array(42)

print(arr)

# 1-D Arrays

import numpy as np

ar = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])

print(arr)

# 2-D Arrays

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(arr)

#3-d aray

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])

print(arr)

# we use ndim attribute  to tell us which dimensions the array is 


# for example

a = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])


print(a.ndim)

# output will come out to be 4

# Create a 2D array of ones with shape (3, 4)
# this will create an array of metrcis 3 and 4 of ones

b = np.ones((3, 4))
print(b)

# Create a sequence from 0 to 9
# it will arrange the numbers in ascending order 

a = np.arange(10)
print(a)  

# it will print numbers w a gap of 2
# works just like for loop 
b = np.arange(2, 11, 2)
print(b)  

# what this does is that it divides the numebr 5 times among 0 and 1

a = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
print(a) 

# Create a 2x2 identity matrix
a = np.eye(2)
print(a)
